##### Connecting to the database
```{r}
library(RSQLite)
cwd <- getwd()
dbFile <- "MediaDB.db"
pathToDb <- paste0(cwd,  .Platform$file.sep, dbFile) # Initializing the db file in the project folder
conn <-
  dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), pathToDb)
```

##### Dropping all triggers before creating them
```{sql connection=conn}
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS test_total_for_positive_values;
```

```{sql connection=conn}
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS recalculate_total_post_insert;
```

```{sql connection=conn}
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS recalculate_total_post_update_for_old_record;
```

```{sql connection=conn}
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS recalculate_total_post_update_for_new_record;
```

```{sql connection=conn}
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS recalculate_total_post_delete;
```


#### Question 1
##### Trigger to validate Total

```{sql connection=conn}
CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS test_total_for_positive_values
BEFORE INSERT ON invoices
BEGIN
  SELECT
    CASE
      WHEN NEW.Total < 0
      THEN RAISE (ABORT, 'Total value needs to be a positive value (>= 0)')
    END;
  END;
```


#### Question 2
##### Note: There seems to be no proper way to add a constraint to a column that already exists in SQLite
Here is my approach for solving question 2

1. Creating a new table called invoices_replica with the total column and associated column constraint
2. Copying over all the existing data from invoices to invoices_replica
3. Deleting the existing invoices table
4. Renaming invoices_replica to invoices

```{sql connection=conn}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invoices_replica;
```

```{sql connection=conn}
-- CREATING THE invoices_replica with the constraints
CREATE TABLE invoices_replica(
InvoiceId INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
CustomerId INTEGER NOT NULL,
InvoiceDate DATETIME NOT NULL,
BillingAddress NVARCHAR(70),
BillingCity NVARCHAR(40),
BillingState NVARCHAR(40),
BillingCountry NVARCHAR(40),
BillingPostalCode NVARCHAR(10),
-- Adding constraint to Total
-- Total >= 0 because when a new invoice is made without associated invoice_items, Total will be 0
Total NUMERIC(10,2) CHECK (Total >= 0.00) DEFAULT 0.00,
CONSTRAINT cust_id FOREIGN KEY (CustomerId) REFERENCES customers(CustomerId)
);
```

```{sql connection=conn}
-- Inserting values from invoices to invoices_replica
INSERT INTO invoices_replica
SELECT * FROM invoices;
```

```{sql connection=conn}
-- Dropping invoices
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS invoices;
```

```{sql connection=conn}
-- Renaming invoices_replica to invoices
ALTER TABLE invoices_replica RENAME TO invoices;
```

#### Question 3
##### Post Insert Trigger
```{sql connection=conn}
-- Creating a trigger called recalculate_total_post_insert
CREATE TRIGGER recalculate_total_post_insert
-- Post Insert Trigger
AFTER INSERT ON invoice_items
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  -- This updates the Total column of invoices to be the SUM of UnitPrice for the given InvoiceId
  UPDATE invoices
    SET total = (
        SELECT SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity)
        FROM invoice_items
        WHERE InvoiceId = NEW.InvoiceId
    )
    WHERE InvoiceId = NEW.InvoiceId;
  END;
```

#### Question 4
##### Post Update Trigger (I've created two update triggers for a reason specified in the examples)
```{sql connection=conn}
-- Creating a trigger called recalculate_total_post_update_for_new_record
CREATE TRIGGER recalculate_total_post_update_for_new_record
-- Post update trigger
AFTER UPDATE ON invoice_items
-- Runs for each row
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  -- This updates the Total column of invoices to be the SUM of UnitPrice for the given InvoiceId
  UPDATE invoices
    SET total = (
        SELECT COALESCE(SUM(NEW.UnitPrice * NEW.Quantity), 0)
        FROM invoice_items
        WHERE InvoiceId = NEW.InvoiceId
    )
    WHERE InvoiceId = NEW.InvoiceId;
  END;
```

```{sql connection=conn}
-- Creating a trigger called recalculate_total_post_update_for_old_record
CREATE TRIGGER recalculate_total_post_update_for_old_record
-- Post update trigger
AFTER UPDATE ON invoice_items
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  -- This updates the Total column of invoices to be the SUM of UnitPrice for the given InvoiceId
  UPDATE invoices
    SET total = (
        SELECT COALESCE(SUM(OLD.UnitPrice * OLD.Quantity), 0)
        FROM invoice_items
        WHERE InvoiceId = OLD.InvoiceId 
    )
    WHERE InvoiceId = OLD.InvoiceId;
  END;
```

##### Post Delete Trigger
```{sql connection=conn}
-- Creating a trigger called recalculate_total_post_update_for_old_record
CREATE TRIGGER recalculate_total_post_delete
-- Post delete trigger
AFTER DELETE ON invoice_items
BEGIN
  -- This updates the Total column of invoices to be the SUM of UnitPrice for the given InvoiceId
  UPDATE invoices
    SET total = (
        -- In case all invoice_items are deleted, then Total is 0
        SELECT COALESCE(SUM(OLD.UnitPrice * OLD.Quantity), 0)
        FROM invoice_items
        WHERE InvoiceId = OLD.InvoiceId
    )
    WHERE InvoiceId = OLD.InvoiceId;
  END;
```



#### Question 5
##### Demonstrating that the constraint on Total is working as expected
```{r}
result <- tryCatch({
  ### Trying to insert -1 in Total is going to throw an Error
  sql <- "INSERT INTO invoices
          VALUES (9000, 2, '2009-01-01 00:00:00', '601 William St', 'California', 'San Jose', 'USA', '94612', -1);"
  dbGetQuery(conn, sql)
result <- dbGetQuery(conn, sql)
}, error = function(e) {
  print(e)
}, finally = {
})
```

##### Demonstrating that the triggers work as expected
The Total for InvoiceId 1 is 1.98 by default
```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT InvoiceId, Total 
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceId = 1;
```

Inserting an item into invoice_items with InvoiceId 1 and UnitPrice 1.99 to increase the Total
```{sql connection=conn}
INSERT INTO invoice_items
VALUES (2250, 1, 7, 1.99, 1);
```

Verifying that the total for InvoiceId 1 has increased to 3.97 (1.98 + 1.99)
```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT InvoiceId, Total 
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceId = 1;
```

Updating the UnitPrice of InvoiceLineId 2250 to 0.99\
Thereby, reducing the Total of InvoiceId 1 by 1\
So the updated Total for InvoiceId 1 should be 2.97
```{sql connection=conn}
UPDATE invoice_items
SET UnitPrice = 0.99
WHERE InvoiceLineId = 2250;
```

Verifying that the Total of InvoiceId 1 is 2.97
```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT InvoiceId, Total 
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceId = 1;
```

Deleting invoice_item with InvoiceLineId 2250
```{sql connection=conn}
DELETE FROM invoice_items
WHERE InvoiceLineId = 2250;
```

Verifying that the Total of InvoiceId 1 has gone back to 1.98
```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT InvoiceId, Total 
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceId = 1;
```

**Note: I'd like to demonstrate a corner case where we assign an existing invoice_item to a different InvoiceId (maybe because it was mistakenly assigned)**
\
For example we change the InvoiceId of InvoiceLineId 1 from 1 to 2, then we have to update the Total values for both InvoiceId 1 and InvoiceId 2 - this is why there are two update triggers
\
Let's take a look at the Total for InvoiceId 1 and 2
```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT InvoiceId, Total 
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceId IN (1, 2);
```

Let's look at the invoice_items of InvoiceId 1
```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT *
FROM invoice_items
WHERE InvoiceId = 1;
```

Let's change the InvoiceId of InvoiceLineId 1 to 2
```{sql connection=conn}
UPDATE invoice_items
SET InvoiceId = 2
WHERE InvoiceLineId = 1;
```

Let's see the update in Total for InvoiceId 1 and InvoiceId 2\
InvoiceId 1 should've reduced by 0.99 and InvoiceId 2 should have increased by 0.99
```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT InvoiceId, Total 
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceId IN (1, 2);
```

**Another corner case is where we delete all invoice_items related to an invoice, right now InvoiceId 1 has only one invoice_item**\
We can see that here
```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT * 
FROM invoice_items
WHERE InvoiceId = 1;
```

Let's delete it
```{sql connection=conn}
DELETE FROM invoice_items
WHERE InvoiceLineId = 2;
```

Now the Total of InvoiceId 1 should be zero
```{sql connection=conn}
SELECT InvoiceId, Total 
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceId = 1;
```

##### Resetting values so that it can be tested again
1. Setting InvoiceLineId 1 back to Invoice 1
```{sql connection=conn}
UPDATE invoice_items
SET InvoiceId = 1
WHERE InvoiceLineId = 1;
```

2. Re-inserting InvoiceLineId 2
```{sql connection=conn}
INSERT INTO invoice_items VALUES (2, 1, 4, 0.99, 1)
```
